# Kubernetes Introduction

<!-- ## 1. Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, and Kubernetes Architecture at Glance

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Kubernetes/k8s is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
