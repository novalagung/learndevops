<!-- ## 1. Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, and Kubernetes Architecture at Glance

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Kubernetes/k8s is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

Kubernetes Component -->
<!-- 

deployments represent a set of multiple, identical Pods with no unique identities.
a deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive.
in this way, Deployments help ensure that one or more instances of your application are available to serve user requests.
deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller.
deployments use a Pod template, which contains a specification for its Pods.
the Pod specification determines how each Pod should look like:
- what applications should run inside its containers
- which volumes the Pods should mount
- its labels, and more. -->
